                    SCIENTISTS HAVE LEARNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE SENSE OF SIGHT IN NUMEROUS WAYS. In front of the tiny
                    pupil of the eye they put, on Mount Palomar, a great monocle 200 inches in diameter, and with it see
                    2000 times farther into the depths of space. Or they look through a small pair of lenses arranged as
                    a microscope into a drop of water or blood, and magnify by as much as 2000 diameters the living
                    creatures there, many of which are among manâ€™s most dangerous enemies. Or, if we want to see distant
                    happenings on earth, they use some of the previously wasted electromagnetic waves to carry
                    television images which they re-create as light by whipping tiny crystals on a screen with electrons
                    in a vacuum. Or they can bring happenings of long ago and far away as colored motion pictures, by
                    arranging silver atoms and color-absorbing molecules to force light waves into the patterns of
                    original reality. Or if we want to see into the center of a steel casting or the chest of an injured
                    child, they send the information on a beam of penetrating short-wave X rays, and then convert it
                    back into images we can see on a screen or photograph.
